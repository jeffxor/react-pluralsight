##Pluralsight ReactJs Application

This is my code from following along with PluralSight's Fundamental React course. It creates a simple quiz game where you pick the author's book from a list. The application runs in a simple Express web server.

#Build and Install
This application require npm and bower to be installed.

```
$>npm install

$>bower install

$>node express.js
```

The application can then be accessed at http://localhost:3000/
